<h3>1.PEROLEUM</h3>
<p1>A petroleum (petrol/gasoline) car uses a spark-ignited internal combustion engine that burns fuel for power, offering smooth, quiet, and responsive driving with quick acceleration, ideal for city commutes, and generally has lower purchase/maintenance costs than diesel cars, though with lower fuel efficiency and mileage. Key features include spark plugs for ignition, simpler designs, and a focus on comfort, making them popular for passenger vehicles. </p1>
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<ol>
    <li> lower purchase price</li>
    <li> smoother & quieter engines</li>
    <li>easier/cheaper maintenance</li>
</ol>
<h3>2.DIESEL</h3>
<p2>Diesel cars use compression-ignition engines for high torque, better fuel efficiency (mileage), and durability, making them great for long distances, but they typically have higher initial costs, can be noisier, and require specialized, sometimes costlier, maintenance than petrol cars, though they offer superior energy conversion and longer engine life due to robust construction. They ignite fuel by compressing air, not with spark plugs, leading to stronger engines but a lower rev range and sluggish acceleration compared to petrol counterparts</p2>
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<ol>
    <li> superior fuel efficiency</li>
    <li> lower CO2 emissions</li>
    <li>excellent low-end torque</li>
</ol>
<h3>EV</h3>
<p3>EVs (Electric Vehicles) are cars powered by electric motors and rechargeable batteries, replacing gasoline engines for quieter, cleaner, and efficient propulsion, with types including Battery Electric (BEVs, fully electric) and Plug-in Hybrids (PHEVs, using both battery and gas), offering benefits like lower running costs and zero tailpipe emissions for BEVs</p3>
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<ol>
    <li> lower running costs</li>
    <li>  reduced tailpipe emissions</li>
    <li>quieter operation</li>
</ol>
